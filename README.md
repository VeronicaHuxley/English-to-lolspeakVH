# English-to-lolspeakVH

For this project, I built an English-to-Lolcat translation engine. It contains a JSON glossary
of more than 2,200 words as a basis (English words that donâ€™t have a Lolcat equivalent are left as they are).

This program is able to read in a plain-text file in English (.txt extension), translates it,
and produces another text file in Lolcat, regardless of the length of the text.
